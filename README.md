# Rock/Paper/Scissor Web Application

This project is a simple web application developed with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack using Typescript. Its primary purpose is to serve as a playground for practicing Typescript development within a React frontend and a backend framework, while adhering to best practices.

## Overview

### Frontend

The frontend of the application provides a user interface that presents three options: rock, paper, or scissors. Players can make their choice and compete against a bot.

### Backend

The backend offers basic API functionality that mirrors the frontend's capabilities. It supports game functionality, enabling players to make their choices and compete against the bot.

### Database

The application leverages a database to store game session choices, outcomes, and overall statistics. This feature allows for tracking game histories and analyzing player performance.

## Possible Future Enhancements

As the project progresses, several additional features are planned for implementation:

- **User Profiles**: Introduce user profiles to personalize the gaming experience and track individual player statistics.
- **Multiplayer Functionality**: Enable players to compete against each other, potentially through matchmaking or lobby systems.
